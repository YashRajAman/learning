Security Enhancements 

Password Hashing [Aleardy Using bcrypt]: 
Instead of storing passwords in plain text, consider using password hashing 
algorithms like bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2 to store hashed passwords. This will add an extra layer of security to your application.

Token Blacklisting: 
Implement a token blacklisting mechanism to revoke tokens when a user logs out or changes their password. This will prevent unauthorized access to user data.

Rate Limiting: 
Introduce rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on your APIs. You can use libraries like fastapi-limiter to achieve this.

User Management

User Profile Management: 
Allow users to update their profile information, such as username, email, or password.

User Role Management: 
Introduce role-based access control (RBAC) to assign different roles to users, such as admin, moderator, or regular user.

User Search: 
Implement a search functionality to find users by username, email, or other criteria.

Additional APIs

Forgot Password: 
Create an API to allow users to reset their passwords using a password reset token sent to their email.

Email Verification: 
Implement an API to send a verification email to users when they create an account or update their email address.

Two-Factor Authentication: 
Add an API to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) using Time-Based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) or HMAC-based One-Time Passwords (HOTP).

Analytics and Logging

User Activity Logging: 
Log user activity, such as login attempts, password changes, or profile updates, to monitor user behavior and detect potential security threats.

API Analytics: 
Collect analytics on API usage, such as request frequency, response times, and error rates, to optimize your application's performance.

Integrations

Social Media Integration: 
Allow users to log in using their social media accounts, such as Google, Facebook, or Twitter.

Third-Party Service Integration: 
Integrate your application with third-party services, such as payment gateways, to provide additional functionality.
