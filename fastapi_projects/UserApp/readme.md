This is a fastapi application built for user actions.

The description about services are provided in blue_print.txt

The application doesn't use sqlalchemy models (i.e orm) to manage
the application rather, it uses sql queries which can be faster than 
orm managed applications. (For complex relational management orms are better at keeping thigs simple.)
