correct the code with these points:

1: Load all the edges using csv files in the location "file_location"
2: The graph can be very large in size, use swap space or disk to compensate for that.
3: Parallelize the data loading and function to run the things in parallel to optimize time constraint.
4: Make as much time and space efficient as possible. Time is more important.
